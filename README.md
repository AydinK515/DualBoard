# MirrorBoard - Split-Screen Whiteboard for Face-to-Face Tutoring

### Purpose & Goal:
MirrorBoard solves a common problem in face-to-face tutoring and teaching scenarios. When an instructor sits across from a student and draws on a traditional whiteboard or tablet, the student sees everything upside-down and backwards, making it difficult to follow along.

### How It Works:

The tutor draws on the top canvas (Tutor View) using their mouse, stylus, or touch input
The bottom canvas (Student View) automatically displays a 180-degree rotated mirror of everything drawn above
This means when the tutor writes "HELLO" normally, the student sees "HELLO" right-side up from their perspective
### Key Features:

- Real-time mirroring with zero delay
- Adjustable canvas heights for both tutor and student views
- Full drawing toolkit (pen, eraser, brush sizes, undo/redo)
- Touch, stylus, and mouse support
- Export drawings as PNG files
- Clean, professional interface suitable for educational environments
### Use Cases:

- Math tutoring (equations, graphs, problem solving)
- Language learning (writing practice, character formation)
- Art instruction
- Technical drawing and diagrams
- Any scenario where visual instruction needs to be shared face-to-face
- The app eliminates the need to physically rotate devices or awkwardly position screens, making the tutoring experience more natural and effective for both parties.
